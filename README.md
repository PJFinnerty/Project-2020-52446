## Project Details

### Question:

The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.

Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:

* Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.

* In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.

* Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

### Personal Perspective:

I have decided to base this project on the comparison of Simple Linear Regression Vs. Polynomial Regression on the Powerproduction dataset.

This comparison, I feel that comparing the accuracy of methods and models of both forms of regression is the best way to outline the various features of analysis and statistical considerations that must be considered when determining the line of best fit for a dataset.

Furthermore, this project is intended to have a second layer of comparison. For each form of regression, an example of bad-practice regression has been compared with an example of accurate modelling. 

The former has been highlighted by carrying out regression on the entire dataset, whilst the accurate models are analysed using Sklearn and are completed on split data samples using the train_test_split method.

I have attempted to touch on the core aspect of the content covered this semester in Fundamentals of Data Analysis and utilise what I have learned to unravel the porject requirements.
